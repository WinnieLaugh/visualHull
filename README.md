# visualHull
This is a visuall hull code

This is written by someone else as an open source program and I did some of the modification to meet my own needs.

The start up file is the visualHull.m, and I remembered that this program also used some function of visual studio 2013, 
maybe it is better to make sure you have vision studio installed on your PC before you start running this program.

The RotPosCal.m was used to calculate the rotation matrix and the position matrix of the camera. And the myIO.m, RotPosNoise.m, imageNoise.m,
and all the folders except the +spacecarving folder were written to meet my specific needs. They may be useless in other situations.
